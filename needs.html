							<h3> Project Title </h3>
							<p></p>
The Inclusion of a module on learning disability awareness in among college of Education students
<p></p>
<h4> Project Description </h4>
At the beginning of 2010’s, a strong push towards inclusion and equality led to a growing call for educating students with learning disabilities with non-disability students in the same classroom. Consequently, general education teachers, many of which were inadequately trained or prepared became the primary instructors of all these students many of which (Browell et al. 2006, pp 17). The lack of learning disability training in most teacher education curriculum is evident in the lack of awareness among teachers. 
According to Rosenzweig (2009), there is a growing concern that teacher and instructional designer preparations and training with lies on university education are failing to meet the current changes in our educational system. The failure is observed in the lack of awareness of learning disabilities among teachers who graduate from their programs.
The Foundational classes such as Instructional Design - EME6609 is created to introduce students to the idea and tenet of instructional design (ID). It is a beginner’s guide into the word of ID for many students. It is usually followed by an advanced course in ID however, many students are not obligated to go that route. As such students complete the course without awareness or understanding of varying learning disabilities. As a result, students with learning disabilities do not receive the “appropriate” education for their needs (Lipsky & Gartner, 1996, pp 780). 
The inclusion of a learning disability awareness module will ensure that upon completion of their first semester classes, college of ed students will gain knowledge to design instructions that accommodate all learners, including those with learning disabilities. Essentially, this project seeks to develop an instructional design module on learning disability (LD) awareness. 
<p></p>
<h4> Needs Assessment </h4>
According to Brown (1995, p.35), a needs assessment will identify information needed to justify the requirement of additional curriculum in an existing course.
To assess the general level of learning disability awareness among new college of Ed students taking classes in the Spring 2021 semester, a survey instrument was designed using the online survey platform Google Forms and a series of interviews were conducted. The survey comprised 20 questions. Part A was to assess the level of experience of students and their motivation for enrolling in the classes. Part B of the survey was a combination of likert scale response and text response questions. Part B further sort to gauge students' awareness of inclusive education and issues on students with learning disabilities. Also, part B of the survey instrument was used as the interview instrument for sampled respondents who opted to chat. 
The response to the survey and interviews was analyzed to identify where students had knowledge of learning disabilities, were comfortable discussing these issues, expectations from their first class and whether they were confident in dealing LD issues in their design and or instructions. A further cross tabulation analysis was conducted to assess which respondent demographic (gender,age group, level of education, teaching experience and motivation) were more aware of LD issues and which demographic needed more awareness. The results of the needs assessment survey informed the recommendation for the addition of an inclusive education module to freshman classes.
<p></p>
<h4> Brief summary of sampled survey results: </h4>
The needs assessment survey instruments were sent out to about 10 college college of Ed students. Of the 10 invited to participate in the survey, 4 responded so far and the survey is open for two more weeks. 
At the current 40% response rate, half (50%) of total respondents had little to no knowledge on inclusive education and students with learning disability issues. Also, Seventy-five percent of respondents expected to learn about LD in their first class. 
Also, fifty percent of all respondents expressed the desire to include LD in their design but lacked the awareness and skill to do so. In addition, 25% of respondents expected to learn about LD issues as part of the first class. Majority of respondents so far do not plan to enroll in the advanced ID class. 
Of all respondents, there were 75% Female. A majority of respondents had Masters and professional level certificates (75%) and had an average teaching and/or instructional design experience of 4 years. The largest motivation for enrolling in their first class was gaining understanding in foundational classes (75%) and compulsory spring class (25%).
<p></p>
<h4>Goal Analysis</h4>
Given the lack of awareness of inclusive education and students with LD issues as shown by 75% of survey respondents so far, and the desire to learn, a module on design for students with LD’s should be added to the foundational Instructional design class. 
This will create awareness among students who enroll in only the introductory class and equip them with the knowledge on issues to consider when designing instructions and teaching. A goal will be to include a module in the before the beginning of the project or as part of the initial historical reading material. 
In a recent discussion, a colleague mentioned how difficult it was for her to identify a student  in her class with a learning disability and remarked that the student was unwilling to ask for help. This speaks to the issue at hand and equipping teachers with the skill to handle these issues and asking the right questions so that students with LD’s don't feel isolated and singled out would help. 
<p></p>
<h4> Goal Statement: </h4>
At the end of their first class, students will gain an understanding and awareness of issues on students with learning disabilities. They will acquire knowledge in close captions in video presentations, “chunked” reading passages for striving readers, and other ADA guidelines (cite).
<p></p>
<h4>Learner Analysis and Context Analysis</h4>
The College of Education graduate student class is a graduate level course with students in Masters and PhD programs. The typical student is an adult with graduate level course load and some of whom are working professional by day and student by night. As such, they make optimal use of their limited time daily. Their commitment to enrolling in class is indicative of their resilience and tenacity. It will serve them a great deal, if a module on inclusive education is added to each class they take. This could be broken in bits i.e. pods on Canvas for easy consumption. A third pod on LD could be added to each module in connection with the main topic. Students in the EME6609 have extensive and broad experience with graduate level coursework and will find it easier to acquaint themselves with issues facing students with LD’s. Plus, more than half of respondents have indicated the desire to learn about LD issues.  
The addition of an extra asynchronous module (Module A) in the current course schedule with the schedule below. Objectives for Module A includes;
Student will be gain understanding of historical context of learning disabilities
Student will identify various learning disabilities
Students will be able to link an app that reads text assignments out loud to visually impaired students
Students  will demonstrate mastery of learning disabilities in video presentation with closed captions.
Students will demonstrate "Chunked" reading passages for striving readers, where students are prompted to summarize small paragraphs rather than the text as a whole.
